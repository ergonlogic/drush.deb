Description: Scripting and command-line toolkit for Drupal.
 Drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal. Drush
 core ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code like
 modules/themes/profiles. Similarly, it runs update.php, executes sql queries
 and DB migrations, and misc utilities like run cron or clear cache. Drush can
 be extended by 3rd party commandfiles.
